 * nxmem — fixed-address memory for the Nintendo Switch build (project-dam).
 *
 * Horizon has no mmap(MAP_FIXED). This places page-aligned heap memory at an
 * exact virtual address, the way the PC port's fixed mmaps do, using the two
 * methods verified on hardware by tools/switch/memprobe (docs/switch/PLAN.md
 * §2):
 *   - inside the process's stack region: svcMapMemory (heap -> stack region);
 *   - elsewhere in the ASLR region: svcMapProcessCodeMemory on the own process
 *     handle, then svcSetProcessMemoryPermission(RW).
 * Used for the cart image (0x10000000), the DRAM arena (0x70000000 + KSEG0
 * mirror) and the game-thread stacks (0xA0000000).
